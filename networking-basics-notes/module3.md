## 3.1 Wireless Networks

Smartphones use wireless connectivity features and they are:  
1. **Global Positioning System (GPS)** - Uses satellites to transmit signals that cover the globe. The smartphone uses this to calculate the phones location.
2. **Wi-Fi** - Wi-Fi transmitters and receivers locate within the smartphone and enables it to connect to local networks.
3. **Bluetooth** - Wireless technology that allows devices (like a speaker and a phone) to communicate over short distances.
4. **Near Field Communication (NFC)** - Wireless technology that enables data to be exchanged by devices in close proximity (Apple Pay).
