## 1.1 Network Types

**Small Home Network** - Connects a few computers to each other and to the internet.  
**SOHO Networks** - Allows computers in a home office or a remote office to connect to a corporate network or access centralised shared resources.  
**Medium to Large Networks** - Used by corporations or schools and can have many locations with hundreds of interconnected hosts.

**Mobile Devices**  
Smartphone, Tablet, Smartwatch and Smart Glasses  
**Connected Home Devices**  
Security System, Appliances, Smart TV and Gaming Consoles  
**Other Connected Devices**  
Smart Cars, Sensors, Medical Devices and RFID Tags  

## 1.2 Data Transmission  
Computers use binary codes to represent and interpret letters, numbers and special characters with bits.  
1 bit = 1 or 0  
8 bits = 1 byte  
**ASCII** - American Standard Code for Information Interchange  

**Common methods of signal transmission:**  
**1. Electrical Signals** - Transmission is achieved by representing data as *electrical pulses* on copper wire.  
**2. Optical Signals** - Transmission is achieved by converting the electrical signals into *light pulses*.  
**3. Wireless Signals** - Transmission is achieved by using *infrared*, *microwave* or *radio waves* through the air.

**SOHO**'s use *copper wire* cables or Wi-Fi.  
**Large Networks** use *fiber-optic* cables.

## 1.3 Bandwidth and Throughput  
| Unit of Bandwidth       | Abbreviation   |
|-------------------------|----------------|
| Bits per second         | bps            |
| Kilobits per second     | Kbps           |
| Megabits per second     | Mbps           |
| Gigabits per second     | Gbps           |
| Terabits per second     | Tbps           |

**Throughput** is the measure of the *transfer of bits* across the medium *over a given period* of time.  
**Latency** refers to the *amount of time* (including delays) it takes for data to travel *from one point to another*.  
**Bandwidth** is measured in the *number of bits* that can be *sent* across the media *in a second*.
