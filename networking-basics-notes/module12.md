# Module 12
## 12.1 Network Boundaries
**Gateway** is a way for *traffic* to leave one local network and be forwarded to other remote networks.  

The **router's IPv4 address** on the local network **becomes the default gateway**.  

The **router** *assigns private IP addresses* to the devices in the internal network.  

**ISP's use DHCP** to *give the router a public IP address* that is routable on the internet which allows devices to access the internet.  

**Hosts on the same network use the same default gateway**.  

The **default gateway of a host computer** is the **logical address of the router interface** on the same network as the host computer.
