# Module 4
## 4.1 Home Network Basics

**Two primary types of ports:**  
**1. Ethernet Ports** - these ports connect to the internal switch portion. All devices connected are on the same local network  
**2. Internet Ports** - used to *connect* the device *to another network*. Different network compared to the Ethernet Ports  

**Wireless technologies** used in home networks are in the *unlicenced* **2.4GHz and 5GHz** frequency ranges.  

**Wired technologies**  
**1. Category 5e Cable** - *most common* wiring *used in LAN*  
**2. Coaxial Cable** - has an inner wire surrounded by a tubular insulating layer, that is surrounded by a tubular conducting shield. Commonly used in *TV* and *Satellite*  
**3. Fiber-optic Cables** - can carry data at *high speeds* over *long distances*  

## 4.3 Wireless Standards  
**Wireless Router Settings:**  
**1. Network Mode** - determines the type of technology that is supported  
**2. Network Name (SSID)** - used to identify the WLAN  
**3. Standard Channel** - specifies the channel over which communication occurs. Default is set to Auto to allow the access point (AP) to determine the optimal channel  
**4. SSID Broadcast** - determines if the SSID will be broadcast to all devices within range. Default = Enabled  

**Wireless technical standards** are *governed* by the **Institude of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)**  
**Testing wireless LAN devices** are *governed* by the **Wi-Fi Alliance**
