# Module 6
## 6.1 Network Media Types

**Metal wires within cables** - Data is encoded into electrical impulses  
**Glass or plastic fibers within cables** - Data is encoded into pulses of light  
**Wireless transmission** - Data is encoded via modulation of specific frequencies of electromagnetic waves  

**Common Networking Cables**  
**1. Twisted-Pair Cable** - Ethernet technology generally uses twisted-pair cables to interconnect devices. Most common in networking.   
**2. Coaxial** - Earliest type of network cabling developed and used by cable TV companies and for connecting components that make up satellite communication systems. Used as  high-frequency transmission line to carry broadband signals.  
**3. Fiber-Optic Cable** - Carries digital information at very high speeds over long distances. Electrical interferene doesn't affect the signal.
